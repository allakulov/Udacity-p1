Project Motivation
This small research project sets out to answer the following main questions: 

1. What are the top 5 and bottom 5 countries in terms of corruption? 
2. What are the top 5 and bottom 5 countries with regard to ease of doing business?
3. Is there a relationship between corruption and ease of doing business?
4. Are there outliers, i.e. countries that don't correspond to the overall relationship between corruption and doing business?


File descriptions
To answer the above questions, two datasets are used:
1. 2019 dataset of the Corruption Percept Index available from:
https://images.transparencycdn.org/images/2019_CPI_FULLDATA.zip

2. Ease of Doing Business Index. 2019 data for all countries was been retrieved at the following web page:
https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/custom-query

Both datasets were saved as comma delimited text file (csv). 


The Jupyter notebook ("Udacity project 1.ipynb") analyzes the data from the two datasets to provide answers to the abovementioned questions.
